    <h1>PhantomJS is Dead, How do I run Jasmine with Gulp?</h1>

    <p>This is short and sweet. I will flesh it out soon, I promise. But for now,
    this should work!</p>

    <p>PhantomJS is dead, and it's very difficult to get it downloaded and working.
      I will walk you through an alternative to get Jasmine running in Gulp.
    </p>

    <p>Note: I have Jasmine working with this set up, but the built in test from Udacity is failing its test for me. But if I add my own tests that I know will pass, they pass.</p>

    <h3>Download gulp-jasmine-browser</h3>
    <code>npm install gulp-jasmine-browser</code>

    <h4>Install a couple other packages we need for the above to run</h4>
    <code>npm install puppeteer</code>
    <code>npm install jasmine-core</code>

    <p></p>

    <p>Tell gulp we want to use Jasmine Browser! </p>
    <p><code>var jasmineBrowser = require('gulp-jasmine-browser');</code></p>

    <h3>Two Options: Run a server in browser, or run in terminal</h3>

    <p>They are both simple, I suggest trying both, just to see what the different code is like and seeing how you can do something multiple ways.</p>

    <h3>In the terminal: </h3>

    <p>Add the following to your gulpfile:</p>
      <pre>gulp.task('tests', function() {
            return gulp.src('tests/spec/extraSpec.js')
            .pipe(jasmineBrowser.specRunner({console: true}))
            .pipe(jasmineBrowser.headless({driver: 'chrome'}));
          });</pre>

    <p>Run <code>gulp tests</code> in your terminal, you should get the output from the tests.</p>

  <h3>In your browser: </h3>

    <p>Add the following to your gulpfile:</p>
      <pre>gulp.task('tests', function() {
            gulp.src('tests/spec/extraSpec.js')
            .pipe(jasmineBrowser.specRunner())
            .pipe(jasmineBrowser.server({port:8888}));
          });</pre>

    <p>Run <code>gulp tests</code> in your terminal. Once your terminal says something like <code>Jasmine server listening on port 8888</code>, go into your browser and go to <code>localhost:8888</code>. You should see the test runin the browser there. When you are done, go back into your terminal and hit Control + C to exit from the server.</p>
