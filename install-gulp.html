    <h1>Installing  Gulp</h1>
    <h2>A Walkthrough of Udacity Part 3, Lesson 16</h2>

    <section id="installing=gulp">
      The course links you to the official Getting Started docs <a href="https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md">here</a>. I will walk you through it.

      <p>Note: When running <code>npm</code> commands on the terminal on a Mac, you may start getting permissions errors which require you to precede your commands with sudo <code>sudo npm install --global gulp-cli</code> for example. This is one way to do it. Many people are uncomfortable with this, for one reason or another (there are a ton of blog posts about it). I recommend checking out this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16151018/npm-throws-error-without-sudo/24404451#24404451">StackOverflow post</a> which gives you a few options to fix this..</p>

      <h3>Installing Gulp Step by Step</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Check for Node and npm
        <ul>
          <li>
              <p>In the terminal type <code>node --version</code></p>
              <p>This checks which version of Node you have installed.
                'Node is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code server-side.' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js">Wikipedia</a>. In our case this just means that it can run some really
                cool and helpful tools for us.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>In the terminal type <code>npm --version</code></p>
            <p>Same as above, only this is npm - node package manager. So Node has all
            these cool tools, but it can be a pain to keep track of them, update them, run them,
            organize them, etc. Npm gives us a way to handle all of that.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Install the <code>gulp</code> command
          <p>In the terminal type <code>npm install --global gulp-cli</code></p>
          <p>Ok, let's break this one down.</p>
          <p>We are using npm, the package manager, to install.</p>
          <p>We are installing it globally (--global), that means it will be available on our whole computer, not just in our project folder.</p>
          <p>Now, note that it says we are installing the gulp <em>command</em>. We are installing this so that we can run gulp on our command line or terminal.</p>
          <p>Look at the end of this line of code, it doesn't just say 'gulp', it says 'gulp-cli'. CLI usually stands for Command Line Interface. So we are installing an interface with gulp on the command line.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Create a package.json file
        <p>You have multiple ways of doing this.
          <ul>
            <li>My preffered way: In the terminal, in the root of project's directory,
              type <code>npm init</code> It will ask you some questions, for now, you can just hit enter on each one. The defaults will work fine for you.
            </li>
            <li>Via the terminal with no set-up: just type <code>touch package.json</code></li>
            <li>In your code editor, simply make a file called package.json</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>Install <code>gulp</code> in your devDependencies
        <p class="warning">If you wish to be able to follow along with the videos and not make any modifications, use this code for this:
          <code>npm install --save-dev gulp</code></p>

        Projects can have dependencies (things that they rely on in order to work) in various
        'stages' of the project. This is usually divided into <code>production</code>,
        <code>development</code>, and <code>testing</code>.

        With <code>--save-dev</code>, we are telling npm that our project is <em>dependent</em> on gulp, but only
        while it is in development. The project will not need Gulp to run once it is online,
        thus having it there would be wasteful.

        <p>The gulp@next tells npm to install a higher version. Currently installing
          <code>gulp</code> installs version 3.9.1. Installing <code>gulp@next</code> installs version 4.0.0</p>

        <code>npm install --save-dev gulp@next</code>
      </li>
      </ul>
